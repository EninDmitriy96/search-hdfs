Its transmitter was located on the third floor of the Center for Design and Maintenance of Instruments, and its signal only reached a radius of from the site. The station's first broadcast was a message from Governor Jorge Treviño Martínez. Programming was supplied by other schools, such as the School of Communication and of Philosophy and Letters. The Central Directorate for Audiovisual Communication coordinated the production of newscasts. In 2001, XHMNU-TV came under the aegis of the rector of the university. On September 24, 2003, XHMNU moved its transmitter and drastically increased its power to 500 kW to cover the entire Monterrey metropolitan area. The next year, an agreement between UANL and Cablevisión Monterrey put channel 53 on cable in the city.
