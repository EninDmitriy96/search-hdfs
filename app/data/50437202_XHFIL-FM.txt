It was owned by Gerardo Millán Ríos and broadcast from Escuinapa with 1,000 watts day and 200 night. In one week in January 1986, XENH was authorized to become XEFIL-AM and to move to 870 kHz in Mazatlán. It was sold to the current concessionaire in 1994. For most of this time, it aired a Regional Mexican format under the Magia Digital name until 2009, when Magia Digital moved to XHVU-FM 97.1 and XEFIL began broadcasting a news/talk format "Radio Noticias 870". XEFIL moved to FM in 2010. In 2012 Radiorama began operating the station and adopted the "W Radio" franchise from Televisa Radio; in 2013, the station switched a Regional Mexican format as La Sinaloense. In May 2016, the station flipped to English classic hits as Éxtasis Digital, which had been on XHVU-FM, when MegaRadio resumed operating that station. MegaRadio reassumed operations of XHFIL in 2017 and moved its Switch pop format from XHZS-FM 100.3. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Sinaloa
