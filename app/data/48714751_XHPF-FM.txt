The original concessionaire was Frecuencia Modulada de Mexicali, S.A. XHPF had been among the last stations to carry the "FM Globo" name, which was used for decades by MVS. By 2018, just XHPF and XHARE-FM in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, were using it. However, the format has since expanded to stations in Guadalajara (XHLC-FM), Monterrey (XHJM-FM), Tuxtepec (XHUH-FM) and Tijuana (XHOCL-FM). ==References== Category:Radio stations in Mexicali Category:Radio stations established in 1976 Category:MVS Radio
