"Stand Up" was released as the next single on August 27. On October 26, "You Can't Fill My Shadow" was announced as the album's third single. But the fifth and last single, "What If I Was Nothing", was the real banger of all the album. A power ballad which has already reached 84 million views in YouTube, in this song Philip Labonte talks about some of his problems with his wife. ==Musical style== Drummer Jason Costa stated about the album: "This is a very guitar, very melody-oriented album. It wasn't very rhythm- based at all. I would just say it's metal; it's a metal album. We've got some heavy songs on there, some heavy, groovy songs on there. We've got some fast, heavy songs on there, we've got some more radio-friendly, melodic songs on there. It's typical ALL THAT REMAINS, really, but we've definitely stepped up the musicianship there and the writing." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;All That Remains * Philip Labonte – lead vocals * Oli Herbert – lead guitar * Mike Martin – rhythm guitar * Jeanne Sagan – bass guitar, backing vocals * Jason Costa – drums ;Production * Adam Dutkiewicz – production, engineering * Jim Fogarty – assistant engineering * Brian Virtue – mixing at Modernist Movement Studios, Nashville, Tennessee * Brad Blackwood – mastering at Euphonic Masters ;Management * Stephen Hutton and Bert Landry for Uppercut Management * Josh Kline – booking for The Agency Group * Murray Richman and Nathan Richman – business management for Richman Business Management * Mike McKoy – legal representation for Serling, Rooks, Ferrara, McKoy & Worob LLP * Beau King – production, concert lighting and tour management * Pete Giberga – A&R; * John Franck – marketing direction ;Artwork * P.R.
