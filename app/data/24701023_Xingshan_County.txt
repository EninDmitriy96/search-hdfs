Xingshan County () is a county of western Hubei, People's Republic of China. It is under the administration of Yichang Prefecture-level City. ==Geography== The county occupies the mountainous north-western corner of Yichang prefecture ("prefecture-level city"), bordering on Badong County in the west and Shennongjia in the north. The highest mountains within the county are Mount Wanchao ( elevation) and Mount Wanfu (). The county seat is in Gaofu town; this is the location that is simply marked as "Xingshan" on less detailed maps. Although the county is away from the Yangtze River itself, and most of its land is at high elevations, the construction of the Three Gorges Dam resulted in the flooding of the valley of the Yangtze's tributary Xiang Xi (香溪, "Fragrant Stream"), where many of the county's residents lived. Accordingly, some 20,000 residents had to be relocated from the flooded areas.Emigration (from the county's official site) It is officially part of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region. ==Climate== ==Administrative division== The county is administratively divided into 8 township-level divisions: 6 towns and 2 townships. Six towns: *Gufu (), Zhaojun (), Xiakou (), Nanyang (), Huangliang (), Shuiyuesi () Two townships: *Gaoqiao Township (), Zhenzi Township () ==Gallery== File:VM 5167 Xingshan County Baishahe Village.jpg|Baishahe Village, Nanyang Town File:VM_5122_Gaoqiao_Township,_Liangtai_River_Valley.jpg|In Liangtai River valley, near Gaoqiao Township File:VM 5202 Xingshan County Houzibao south hydroelectric plant.jpg|Houzibao Hydroelectric Power Station File:VM 5187 Xingshan County Nanyang Town.jpg|Regular bus service operates between the county seat (Gufu) and other major towns ==Notes== ==External links== * Xingshan County People's Government * Xingshan County People's Government - English version * Study on the impact of hydroelectric power at the Xiangxi River, ScienceDirect.
