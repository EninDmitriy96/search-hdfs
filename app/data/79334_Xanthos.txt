Xanthos or Xanthus, also referred to by scholars as Arna, its Lycian name, (, Lycian: êäÄêäïêäëêäèêäÄ Ar√±na, , Latin: Xanthus) was an ancient city near the present- day village of Kƒ±nƒ±k, in Antalya Province, Turkey. The ruins are located on a hill on the left bank of the River Xanthos. The number and quality of the surviving tombs at Xanthos are a notable feature of the site, which, together with nearby Letoon, was declared to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. Xanthos was a centre of culture and commerce for the Lycians, and later for the Persians, Greeks and Romans who in turn conquered the region. As an Lycian important city, Xanthos exerted architectural influences upon its neighbours; the Nereid Monument directly inspired the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus in the Caria region. ==History== Two Lycian heroes of the Trojan War, Sarpedon, is described in the Iliad as an ally of Troy. The acropolis of Xanthos dates from the 8th century BCE. The city was mentioned by ancient Greek and Roman writers. The Greek historian Strabo noted that Xanthos was the largest city in Lycia. The important religious sanctuary of Leto at Letoon, south of Xanthos, dates from the late 6th century BC, and was closely associated with the city and linked by a sacred road. ===Under the Persian Empire=== The Greek historians Herodotus and Appian both described the conquest of the city by the Median general Harpagus on behalf of the Persian Empire, According to Herodotus, the Persians defeated a small Lycian army in the flatlands to the north of the city in . The Lycians retreated into the city, which Harpagus then besieged. The Lycians destroyed their acropolis, and killed their wives, children and slaves, before engaging the enemy in a suicidal attack. During the Persian occupation, a local leadership was installed and by 520 BC it was minting coins. By 516 BC Xanthos had been included in the first nomos of Darius I in the tribute list. === Conquest by Alexander the Great === From Telmessos the army of Alexander the Great marched over the mountains to Xanthos. There representatives each of the cities of the Lycian League, including the port of Phaselis, personally offered the submission of the Lycians' submission, which was accepted. Alexander was encouraged when he found a sacred spring close to the River Xanthus, and obtained from there an inscribed bronze tablet that predicted that the Greeks would destroy the Persian Empire. Reports on the city's surrender to Alexander the Great differ: Arrian reports a peaceful surrender, but Appian claims that the city was sacked. After Alexander's death, Xanthos was captured by Ptolemy I Soter from Antigonos. === Roman rule=== Xanthus was in the Roman province of Lycia. In 42 BC Brutus came to Lycia in the Roman Civil Wars, to obtain funds for his campaign in that year before the Battle of Philippi. The Lycian League refused to contribute; Brutus besieged Xanthos and the city was once again destroyed and only 150 Xanthian men survived the carnage. It was rebuilt under Mark Antony. ==Archaeology== Excavations at Xanthos have shown that wooden structures were destroyed in ,probably by the Athenian Kimon. Xanthos was later rebuilt in stone. The Nereid Monument, the Tomb of Payava, and the original sculptures of the Harpy Tomb are exhibited in the British Museum. The Harpy Tomb itself is located in its original location at Xanthos, now with replica reliefs. The archeological excavations and surface investigations at Xanthos have yielded inscriptions in both the Lycian language and Greek, including bilingual texts that are useful in the understanding of Lycian. The Xanthian Obelisk, otherwise known as the Inscribed Pillar, is a trilingual stele which was found in the city; it records an older Anatolian language conventionally known as the Milyan. ==Location== The River Xanthos, as seen from the ruins|thumb Xanthos is located near to the modern village of Kƒ±nƒ±k. ==World Heritage Site== Xanthos was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with nearby Letoon, in 1988. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 450 * ==Further reading== * * * * * * * ==External links== * Titular Episcopal See of Xanthus from gcatholic.org * Images of Xanthos from PBase.com * Information about Xanthos from Turkish Archaeological News * A virtual tour of Room 17 at the British Museum, which contains the reliefs from the Nereid Monument.
