XF-73 (Exeporfinium chloride) is an experimental drug candidate. It is an anti-microbial that works via weakening bacteria cell walls. It is a potential treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and possibly Clostridium difficile. It is being developed by Destiny Pharma Ltd. (Shows molecular structure.) Structurally, it is a dicationic porphyrin. It has completed a phase I clinical trial for nasal decolonisation of MRSAâ€”being tested against 5 bacterial strains. It seems unlikely to cause MRSA to develop resistance to it. In 2014, a phase 1 clinical trial for nasal administration was run.Study of the Nasal Decolonisation of Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) and the Safety and Tolerability of XF-73 Nasal Gel in Healthy Subjects , another phase 1 clinical trial (for nasal administration) completed recruiting in 2016 but no results have been posted.Study of the Safety and Local Tolerability of Intranasal Gel Formulations of XF-73 ==References== Category:Antimicrobials Category:Tetrapyrroles
