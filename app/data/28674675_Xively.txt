Xively (formerly known as Cosm and Pachube) is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform owned by Google. Xively offers product companies a way to connect products, manage connected devices and the data they produce, and integrate that data into other systems. It is pronounced "zively" (rhymes with lively). ==History== In 2007, London architect Usman Haque founded Pachube (pronounced Patch bay) as a data infrastructure and community for the Internet of Things. Following the nuclear accidents in Japan in 2011, Pachube was used by volunteers to interlink Geiger counters across the country to monitor the fallout. In July 2011, Pachube announced that they had been acquired by LogMeIn and renamed to Cosm. Cosm came out of beta development and was rebranded as Xively to become a Public Cloud for the IoT in May 2013. Google purchased Xively from LogMeIn on March 20, 2018. ==Products and services== ===Xively Cloud Services=== A Platform as a Service built for the IoT.
