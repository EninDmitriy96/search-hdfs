XHRD-FM 104.5/XERD-AM 1240 is a combo radio station in Pachuca, Hidalgo in Mexico. It is owned by Grupo ACIR and carries its La Comadre grupera format. ==History== XERD received its first concession on October 4, 1945 as XEPK-AM, initially on 1420. The station came to air on December 1 of that year as the first radio station in Hidalgo; Governor Vicente Aguirre del Castillo was present at its inauguration. It was owned by Red Central Radiof√≥nica. Soon after, XEPK moved down the dial to 1190 and became a daytimer. In the 1980s, its callsign became XEFIE-AM and gave birth to an FM station XHFIE-FM 104.5. In the mid-1990s, XEPK became XERD-AM 1240 and XHRD-FM 104.5 as part of a callsign swap with the original XERD at 1420, now sister station XHPK-FM 92.5. ==References== Category:Radio stations established in 1945 Category:Radio stations in Hidalgo (state) Category:Grupo ACIR
