A Night in Tunisia is a studio album by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, released in May 1961 through Blue Note Records. It was recorded in August 1960 at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. In the original liner notes by Barbara J. Gardner, she wrote: "This album is a prime example of Blakey's expressed desire to showcase his young talent. Not only is there extended solo room for the musicians; further, all but the title tune were written and arranged by the talented junior jazz citizens in his group". ==Reception== The contemporaneous DownBeat reviewer praised the soloing, and highlighted Blakey's playing on "Kozo's Waltz": "His solo is truly a remarkable demonstration of modern drumming. This is searing passion and astounding energy, not to mention impeccable time". ==Track listing== # "A Night in Tunisia" (D. Gillespie, F.
