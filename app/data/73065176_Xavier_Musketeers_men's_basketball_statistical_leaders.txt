thumb|250px The Xavier Musketeers men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Xavier Musketeers men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Musketeers represent Xavier University in the NCAA's Big East Conference. Xavier began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1919. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway. The NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Xavier's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season. ==Scoring== Career 1 Byron Larkin 2,696 1984–85 1985–86 1986–87 1987–88 2 Trevon Bluiett 2,261 2014–15 2015–16 2016–17 2017–18 3 David West 2,132 1999–00 2000–01 2001–02 2002–03 4 Romain Sato 2,005 2000–01 2001–02 2002–03 2003–04 5 Tyrone Hill 2,003 1986–87 1987–88 1988–89 1989–90 6 Lenny Brown 1,885 1995–96 1996–97 1997–98 1998–99 7 Tu Holloway 1,833 2008–09 2009–10 2010–11 2011–12 8 Anthony Hicks 1,805 1979–80 1980–81 1981–82 1982–83 9 Jamie Gladden 1,780 1989–90 1990–91 1991–92 1992–93 10 Steve Thomas 1,722 1962–63 1963–64 1964–65 1965–66 Season 1 Byron Larkin 792 1986–87 2 Steve Thomas 779 1963–64 3 Byron Larkin 758 1987–88 4 Jordan Crawford 718 2009–10 5 Trevon Bluiett 676 2017–18 6 Trevon Bluiett 665 2016–17 7 Byron Larkin 654 1985–86 8 Lenny Brown 653 1998–99 9 Tyrone Hill 646 1989–90 10 David West 644 2002–03 Single Game 1 Steve Thomas 50 1963–64 Detroit 2 David West 47 2002–03 Dayton 3 Byron Larkin 45 1985–86 Loyola of Chicago Steve Thomas 45 1963–64 Cincinnati Gene Smith 45 1951–52 Georgetown, Ky. ==Rebounds== Career 1 Tyrone Hill 1,380 1986–87 1987–88 1988–89 1989–90 2 Bob Pelkington 1,325 1961–62 1962–63 1963–64 3 David West 1,308 1999–00 2000–01 2001–02 2002–03 4 Brian Grant 1,080 1990–91 1991–92 1992–93 1993–94 5 Dave Piontek 995 1953–54 1954–55 1955–56 6 Bob Quick 939 1965–66 1966–67 1967–68 7 Joe Viviano 906 1956–57 1957–58 1958–59 8 Romain Sato 892 2000–01 2001–02 2002–03 2003–04 9 Tyrique Jones 874 2016–17 2017–18 2018–19 2019–20 10 Derek Strong 805 1987–88 1988–89 1989–90 Season 1 Bob Pelkington 567 1963–64 2 Corny Freeman 526 1956–57 3 Bob Pelkington 454 1962–63 4 Tyrone Hill 403 1988–89 5 Tyrone Hill 402 1989–90 6 Dave Piontek 399 1955–56 7 David West 378 2002–03 Joe Viviano 378 1957–58 9 Bob Quick 365 1967–68 10 Luther Rackley 363 1968–69 Single Game 1 Bob Pelkington 31 1963–64 St. Francis (PA) 2 Bob Pelkington 30 1963–64 Canisius 3 Corny Freeman 28 1956–57 Minnesota Corny Freeman 28 1956–57 Loyola (MD) Corny Freeman 28 1956–57 W.
