Xiaodong Wang (, born 1963) is a Chinese biochemist best known for his work with cytochrome c. His laboratory developed an in vitro assay for the activation of the apoptosis related proteinase Caspase-3. This allowed the biochemical purification of a complex of Cytochrome c, Caspase-9 and the Apoptotic Protease Activating factor-1 (APAF1). These components are essential for forming a ternary complex called the apoptosome that activates Caspase-3 downstream of the intracellular or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. He was awarded the 2006 Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine. Wang is a member of United States National Academy of Sciences and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Currently he is the director of the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing. ==Honors and awards== * 2020, King Faisal International Prize in Medicine.International King Faisal Prize 2020 * 2007, Richard Lounsbery Award, from the National Academy of Sciences, US * 2006, Shaw Prize, from the Shaw Foundation * 2004, NAS Award in Molecular Biology * 2003, Hackerman Award, from the Welch Foundation * 2001, Paul Marks Prize, from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center * 2000, Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry, from American Chemical Society ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American biochemists Category:Beijing Normal University alumni Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Category:Chinese biochemists Category:People from Xinxiang Category:Chemists from Henan Category:Educators from Henan Category:University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center faculty Category:Biologists from Henan Category:Richard-Lounsbery Award laureates Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization
