Xanthichthys ringens, the Sargassum triggerfish, is a species of triggerfish from the Western Atlantic, ranging from North Carolina (USA) to Brazil. ==Description== Also known as the Redtail triggerfish, Xanthichthys ringens is often found in the Western Atlantic, ranging from South Carolina, through Gulf of Mexico to Lesser Antilles and Brazil. It lives in Tropical marine reefs at depths of 25 to 80 meters (82 to 262.5 ft). It generally reaching a size of 25cm (9.8 in). Xanthichthys ringens has three dorsal spines, 26-29 dorsal soft rays, and 23â€“27 anal soft rays. Its coloration includes three silvery-blue prominent diagonal grooves from below and behind mouth running nearly to gill opening, appearing as light brownish gray to a light blue with rows of dark spots on body. The caudal (tail) fin is pale with orange-red margins and a large orange-red crescent at the end of the tail. Xanthichthys ringens inhabits seaward reef slopes, usually well below 30 m, where in some places they are among the most common fish, solitary or in small groups. Spawns in deep water young live among floating Sargassum, hence the name of Sargassum triggerfish. The fish feeds on crabs, shrimp, sea urchins and zooplankton. Like other members of triggerfish, the sargassum triggerfish occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. ==Gallery== File:Sargassum Triggerfish (Xanthichthys ringens).jpg File:Sargassum triggerfish Xanthichthys ringens.jpg File:Xanthichthys ringens Sargassam Trigger.jpg ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Balistidae Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fish described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus
