Xai-Xai () is a city in the south of Mozambique. Until 1975, the city was named João Belo. It is the capital of Gaza Province. As of 2007 it has a population of 116,343. ==History== ===Portuguese rule=== Xai-Xai, formerly João Belo, developed in the early 1900s, under Portuguese rule, as a companion port to Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), though its economic significance was never on par with Mozambique's largest city. Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Xai-Xai was known as João Belo, in the Overseas Province of Mozambique. João Belo grew and developed under Portuguese rule as a port, agricultural and industrial centre (rice and cashew were harvested and processed), a provider of services, including a district hospital and banking, and an administrative centre. Tourism was also important with beaches and hotels.JOÃO BELO-XAI-XAI, a film of João Belo, Portuguese Mozambique, before 1975.
