The A9 autoroute (La Languedocienne/La Catalane) is a motorway in southern France. The road forms part of the European route E15, as does the A9 road (Scotland). The road runs between Orange and Perthus, in the Pyrénées- Orientales at the frontier with Spain where it becomes the Autopista AP-7. The route passes the following major towns and cities Perpignan (Pyrénées- Orientales), Narbonne (Aude), Béziers and Montpellier (Hérault), Nîmes (Gard) and Orange (Vaucluse) before joining the A7 autoroute (Marseille to Lyon). The route is 2x3 as far south as exit 41 (Perpignan-Nord); widening between exit 41 and the Spanish frontier is currently (2012) in progress. The A9 autoroute was operated by the Autoroutes du Sud de la France (ASF), taken over in 2006 by Vinci Autoroutes. The cost of travelling the whole road through the Languedoc-Roussillon region in a car is 23.70 euros (from 1 February 2012).ASF: Tarifs applicable au 1er février == Montpellier == Around Montpellier the road splits into the A9 and the A709, the latter of which is toll-free. Exits 28 to 32 (inclusive) of the A9 can be reached only from the A709.
