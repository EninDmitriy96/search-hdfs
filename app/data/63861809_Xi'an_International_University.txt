In 1996, with the approval of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, the college became one of the first private academic institutions in Shaanxi province to award diplomas through examination. In May 2000, with the approval of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, XAIU became a vocational college. In March 2005, with the approval of China's Ministry of Education, XAIU became an undergraduate college and was officially renamed Xi'an International University (Chinese: 西安外事学院). Successfully adapting to its new role, in June 2009 (4 years after the first students enrolled in the first undergraduate programs), Xi'an International University was granted the right to award bachelor's degrees. In May 2009, XAIU also established the College of Entrepreneurship (Chinese: 创业学院), the first entrepreneurship college established by a private university in China. In 2010, the university established a training platform for students to obtain a 'Master's degree in Business Administration and Entrepreneurship'.

The academy has seven departments: the Department of Chinese Studies, the Department of Chinese Painting, the Department of Chinese Music, the Department of Calligraphy, the Department of Wushu (Kungfu), the Department of Tea Art, and the Department of Chess Art. ==Campus culture== === Values=== Values ===Motto=== The university motto 化鱼成龙 (English: the fish that evolves into a dragon), is the spirit of the campus culture. Legend has that in the university's Yuhua Lake, a fish turned into a dragon. ===Legend=== XAIU is located in Yuhuazhai (Yuhua Village), in Xi'an's Yanta District. According to legends, it is the place where Princess Yuhua, daughter of King Wu of the Zhou dynasty, built a stage to offer sacrifices to Heaven (The remains from the Yangshao Civilization, around 5000 – 3000 B.C.). This stage was found during the construction of the campus and a beautiful park was built around that platform. In the Tang dynasty (618 – 907 A.D.), this area was the auspicious place where imperial examination candidates prayed for good luck, hoping that they could be someone useful to society, in other words, "to become a dragon". After that, people changed the name Yuhua 雨花 (English: the flower in rain) into Yuhua 鱼化 (English: the fish evolves). Since then, it is said that whoever comes to this land will achieve their goals and fulfill their aspirations. ==International education== XAIU was among the first private universities to deliver international cooperation education and foreign student education in Shaanxi Province.
