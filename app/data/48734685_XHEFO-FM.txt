It was owned by Francisco Luis Medina and operated by the Uranga family. Radiorama acquired XEFO in the 1980s. In 2004, it became the franchise of the W Radio news format. In 2007, it switched to Éxtasis Digital, an English-language adult contemporary format previously on XEHES-AM 1040. In 2011, XEFO started broadcasting on FM as XHEFO-FM 92.5. In 2017, XHEFO flipped to Súper, a pop format, when Grupo Audiorama Chihuahua replaced Radiorama as the operator of XHEFO in its entrance into Chihuahua. The station broke from Audiorama in late 2018, by which time the format had evolved in a romantic direction with the new operator being Grupo Bustillos Radio. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Chihuahua Category:Mass media in Chihuahua City Category:Radio stations established in 1965 Category:1965 establishments in Mexico
