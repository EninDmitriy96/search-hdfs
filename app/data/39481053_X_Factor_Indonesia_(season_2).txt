X Factor Indonesia is an Indonesian television music competition to find new singing talent; the winner of which receives a 1 billion rupiahs recording contract with Sony Music Indonesia. The second season aired on 3 April 2015 and is produced by RCTI in-house production and Fremantle Media Indonesia led by Fabian Dharmawan, RCTI's head of production, together with FM's SVP content and production, Glenn Sims. Robby Purba resumes his role as the host of the show alongside returning judges Ahmad Dhani, Rossa, and Bebi Romeo, while Anggun is replaced by Afgan due to her new commitment as a judge for Asia's Got Talent. The competition was won by Jebe & Petty and Rossa emerged as the winning mentor for the second time. ==Judges and hosts== Robby Purba was the first cast member confirmed to return for the second season in July 2014 during an interview with media. In January 2015, Anggun tweeted that she would leave X Factor Indonesia for an international project which was later revealed to be a judging role for Asia's Got Talent. Her replacement was later confirmed to be young pop star Afgan after RCTI released a series of promos featuring the judges for the second season, which include the remaining judges from the first season Ahmad Dhani, Rossa, and Bebi Romeo, on the late of March 2015. ==Selection process== === Auditions === The producers' auditions began on January 14–15, 2015 at the Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java. More producers' auditions were held on January 17–18 at the State University of Medan in Medan, North Sumatra, January 24–25 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta, February 3–4 at the Sasana Budaya Ganesha in Bandung, West Java and concluded on February 10–12 at the Balai Samudera in Jakarta, Jakarta Special Capital Region.

These auditions individually occur simultaneously before both the judges and a live studio audience; and with such audience in attendance able to applaud/cheer approval or disapproval and perhaps influencing the judges. The auditions were broadcast on April 3, 10, 17, and 24 episodes. ===Bootcamp=== 119 acts reached the bootcamp in Jakarta, which includes three sets of challenge. On day one, each act has to perform an a cappella song for 30 second in front of the judges. Afterwards 43 acts were eliminated and the remaining 76 acts were grouped into pairs that will participate in a sing-off duel on the second day, similar to The Voice's battle round. The number of contestants were further reduced after the judges chose only 12 acts for each category, with the exception of only 7 acts for Groups category, to put through to the final challenge. In addition, the judges also gave a second chance for several contestants who were rejected as soloists to continue the competition as groups and formed 3 new groups (a girl duo, a mix duo, and a 5-piece girl group), thus increasing the number of acts from Groups category into 10. It was also revealed that Dhani would mentor the Overages, Rossa would mentor the Groups, Afgan would mentor the Girls, and Bebi would mentor the Boys. The first two challenges of bootcamp were broadcast on May 1 episode. The final round of bootcamp follows the new format of six-chair challenge featured on the American and the British version of the show. Judges make decisions on whom to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a seat in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. After the six-chair challenge, the number of remaining acts were narrowed down to 24. The six-chair challenge were broadcast on May 8 and 15 episodes.
