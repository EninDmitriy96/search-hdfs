Xavier High School is an American independent university-preparatory high school for boys run by the USA Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus, in the Chelsea neighborhood of the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York. Named for St. Francis Xavier (1506–1552), it was founded by John Larkin in 1847 as the College of St. Francis Xavier and also known as St. Francis Xavier College. == History == The school was founded in 1847 by John Larkin, a professor at St. John's College in Rosehill Manor, then in Westchester County, now a part of the Borough of the Bronx, and which later became Fordham University. It taught boys from the age of eight to twenty-one. The Regents of the University of the State of New York chartered Xavier in 1861. A military- training unit began at the school in 1886 under the direction of the National Guard, and membership became mandatory in 1892. Five years later, collegiate and secondary studies were separated into different departments, and the college-level department was closed in 1912. The student regiment became a Junior ROTC unit in 1935, and the school was declared a military institute in 1968, offering four years of military science and training which would be recognized upon enrollment in any branch of the United States military. Participation in military studies was declared optional in 1971. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools since 1927.Xavier High School , Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools.

These goals—being open to growth, intellectually competent, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice—are the foundation of Xavier's curriculum and prepare students to live a life of competence, conscience, and compassion. == Athletics == Xavier, a Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) member, provides its students the opportunity to pursue a wide variety of sports: baseball, basketball, bowling, cross-country, football, fencing, golf, hockey, indoor/outdoor track and field, rugby, soccer, lacrosse, swimming and diving, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling.

The Blue Knight Band won best trombone section at the 2010 Villanova University Big Band Festival. Xavier's current mascot is a knight, and all of its athletic teams are referred to as the Knights. However, for many years, the teams were called the Cadets, a reflection of Xavier's military program, while a terrier was used as a mascot. After a variety of replacements, including the 1980s Bruins, the nickname of the Knights was decided upon in the early 1990s and has been official since. === Football === The Xavier Football program began in the late 19th century. It has a continued rivalry with the Bronx's Fordham Preparatory School. The two schools compete in an annual "Turkey Bowl", the oldest high school football rivalry in New York City. Their very first game against one another took place in the late 19th century when the game was called off due to darkness, ending in a tie. Many of these football matches were played at Manhattan's famed Polo Grounds, until its demolition. === Rugby === Rugby is a popular sport at Xavier. Rugby has varsity status, and fields four teams with over 125 players."USA's Mike Petri says tier two rugby needs more games against elite teams", ESPN, October 12, 2015.

In 2010, the team defended their outdoor victory as sophomores. The Track and Field team competed in the Nationals track meet in Greensboro, North Carolina and finished fifth in both the 4 by 100 and 4 by 200 meter relay, earning Emerging Elite Metals. The team has had much recent success in both cross country and on the track. The cross country team has finished 4th at CHSAA Intersectional Championships in 2011, 5th in 2012, 3rd in 2013, 2nd in 2014, 2nd in 2015 and 1st in 2016, the teams first cross country title in almost a century.

Also in 1996, Xavier won the first 'All-City' Swimming Championship by beating New York City Public School swimming champion Stuyvesant High School. Like many schools in Manhattan, Xavier does not have many athletic resources on-site. As a result, the Xavier Swim Team has used various pools around the city, such as St. Francis College in Brooklyn, the Lower East Side Boys and Girls Club, and Humanities High School. For many years, Xavier had residence at Borough of Manhattan Community College, using their facilities for both practices and dual meets. === Other sports === In 1859 the College of St. Francis Xavier and St. John's College (now Fordham University) played the first collegiate level baseball game, featuring the new nine-man team style of play.
