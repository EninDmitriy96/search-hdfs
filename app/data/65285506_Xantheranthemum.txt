Xantheranthemum, known as the golden vein plant or bronze vein plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It has only one currently accepted species, Xantheranthemum igneum, native to Peru. It is grown as a greenhouse or house plant. There may be some confusion caused by the names of the botanists Linden and Lindau, as some sources associate it with Aphelandra goodspeedii Standl. & F.A.Barkley, along with Chamaeranthemum igneum Regel, Eranthemum igneum Linden, Stenandrium igneum (Linden) Andr√©, Stenandrium pictum N.E.Br., and Xantheranthemum igneum (Linden) Lindau. ==References== Category:Acanthaceae Category:Acanthaceae genera Category:Endemic flora of Peru Category:Monotypic Lamiales genera
