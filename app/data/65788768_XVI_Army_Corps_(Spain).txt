The XVI Army Corps was a military formation of the Spanish Republican Army that fought in the Spanish Civil War. It had an outstanding performance in the Levante campaign. == History == It was originally created on August 6, 1937 from the old Asturian II Army Corps. The command fell to José Gállego Aragüés. It participated in the Battle of Santander, during which it suffered such losses that it was dissolved. In April 1938, the XVI Army Corps was recreated again in the downtown area, with its headquarters in Tarancón. Miguel Palacios Martínez took over the command of the unit. He was soon sent to the Levante front, in support of the republican forces that resisted the nationalist offensive that was trying to take Valencia. The XVI Army Corps was located between the XIII and XIX corps, in the Teruel sector. At the beginning of July it faced a renewed offensive in the Teruel sector, suffering considerable casualties. At the climax of the Battle of Levante, the corps integrated the 39th, 48th and 52nd divisions; after the beginning of the Battle of the Ebro the Levante front stabilized. During the rest of the war, the XVI Corps did not intervene in any relevant military operation. == Command == ;Commanders * Miguel Palacios Martínez; ;Commissars * Antonio Ejarque Pina, of the CNT; ;Chiefs of Staff * Francisco Arderiu Perales; ==Organization== Date Attached Army Integrated divisions Battlefront August 6, 1937 Northern Army 56th, 57th and 58th Asturias-Santander April 30, 1938 GERC 13th, 14th, 48th Reservation July 4, 1938 Levantine Army 39th, 48th Levante August 1938 Levantine Army 39th, 48th, 52nd Levante ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * Category:Military units and formations established in 1937 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1937 Category:Military units and formations established in 1938 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 Category:Corps of Spain Category:Military units and formations of the Spanish Civil War Category:Military history of Spain Category:Armed Forces of the Second Spanish Republic Category:1937 establishments in Spain Category:1937 disestablishments in Spain Category:1938 establishments in Spain Category:1939 disestablishments in Spain
