XHEXL-FM is a radio station on 94.9 FM in Pátzcuaro, Michoacán. It is known as La Ley with a grupera format. ==History== XEXL-AM 1020 received its concession on January 22, 1955. It was owned by Josefina Rodríguez de Laris and broadcast with 1,000 watts. In November 1982, the concession was transferred to a corporation. In the 1990s, XEXL moved to 690 kHz and increased its power to 1,500 watts. This facility was used to conduct Mexico's first public demonstrations of HD Radio on AM in May 2007, to coincide with the annual conference of the National Chamber of the Radio and Television Industry (CIRT), held that year in Pátzcuaro. Normal programs were not broadcast in HD Radio, as it took until 2011 for stations in interior Mexico to be cleared to use the technology. In 2011, XEXL was authorized to migrate to FM as XHEXL-FM 94.9. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Michoacán
