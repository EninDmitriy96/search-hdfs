Aaronsburg is a census-designated place (CDP) in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 613 at the 2010 census. ==History== Aaronsburg was founded in 1786 by Aaron Levy, of which the town is named for him. It is the first town in Pennsylvania (and possibly in the United States) laid out by and named after a Jew. He laid out the town of right in the geographic center of the state, with hopes of it becoming a major settlement. Its orderly planned and aligned streets were designed that the town might one day be the county seat. This, however, never occurred due to the lack of water. The current county seat is Bellefonte. Levy was a prominent Jewish merchant who immigrated to Pennsylvania from Amsterdam sometime between 1760 and 1770 to trade with the native peoples and furnished supplies to the proprietary government. After Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed in 1768, he went west in the land rush and settled at the west branches of the Susquehanna River. There he opened a store to buy and sell to local farmers and native peoples. During the American Revolutionary War, he moved back to Lancaster. As a creditor, Levy was a major financier of the Continental Congress during the conflict, with his loans never fully being repaid. In June 1779, Levy bought a tract of 334 acres in Center County known as the Alexander Grant warranty. Upon this he laid out and planned what would become Aaronsburg. A plot of ground named Aaron's Square was reserved by the founder for public uses, and one of the streets was named Rachel's Way in honor of his wife. On November 16, 1789, Levy gave to the trustees of the Salem Evangelical Church a lot upon which to erect a church and schoolhouse. In 1949 a pageant was held to celebrate Aaronsburg's unique history and namesake. Aaron Levy, a Jewish merchant from Philadelphia, presented members of Salem Lutheran Church with a pewter communion set as a gift. This unusual gesture inspired many, and 50,000 people descended upon Aaronsburg to commemorate it. Attendees included Ralph Bunche, Cornel Wilde, and, later, Ronald Reagan. A short film and a book "The Aaronsburg Story" by Arthur H. Lewis were written about this event, published in 1955. The Aaronsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==Geography== Aaronsburg is located in eastern Centre County, in the northwest corner of Haines Township.
