It extends from Wardija Point in the west for about 3 km to Xlendi Bay in the east, with the steep and rugged cliffs rising from sea level to a height of 105 m. It was identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports 350–500 breeding pairs of Cory's shearwaters and 30–50 pairs of vulnerable yelkouan shearwaters. ==See also== * List of birds of Malta ==References== Category:Gozo Category:Seabird colonies Category:Important Bird Areas of Malta Category:Munxar Category:Kerċem Category:San Lawrenz Category:Cliffs of Malta
