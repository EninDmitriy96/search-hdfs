By the 1980s, it was owned by Pedro Aguiar Villegas, who in turn sold the station to Alica in the early 2000s. In 2008, XETD relocated from 1450 kHz to 570, allowing it to increase power from 250 watts to 5,000. The station received authorization to move to FM as XHETD-FM 92.5 in 2011, but it was required to maintain its AM station, as communities could lose radio service were the AM station to go off the air. After a previous stint as La Patrona, XHETD changed names to Tuba Stereo in late 2019. In February 2022, it once again took on the La Patrona moniker, with a new studio and programming for the Escuinapa area of southern Sinaloa. ==References== ==External links== *La Patrona 92.5 FM Facebook *Grupo Empresarial Alica Category:Radio stations in Nayarit Category:Radio stations in Mexico with continuity obligations
