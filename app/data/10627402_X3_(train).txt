The X3 is an electric multiple unit train used by Arlanda Express on the airport rail link service between Stockholm Central Station and Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden. Alstom built seven of these four-train car units at its Washwood Heath plant in England in 1998/99.World Update Railway Age August 1995 page 64World Update Railway Age November 1998 page 25 The X3 is part of the Alstom Coradia family, and can reach speeds up to 200 km/h. ==Overview== The trains are painted white with yellow ends with a Scandinavian designed interior. The units use standard gauge tracks and are fed electricity at like the rest of the Swedish railway network, but the trains use separate stations at Arlanda and dedicated tracks at Stockholm Central; in both cases, the platforms are higher than at other stations in Sweden, allowing step-free access to the trains without the use of low floors. ==References== ==External links== *Arlanda Express web site *Järnväg.net entry on X3 Category:Alstom Coradia Category:High-speed trains of Sweden Category:Multiple units of Sweden Category:Train-related introductions in 1999 Category:15 kV AC multiple units Category:Alstom multiple units
