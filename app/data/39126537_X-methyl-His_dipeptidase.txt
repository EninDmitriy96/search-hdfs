Xaa-methyl-His dipeptidase (, anserinase, aminoacyl-methylhistidine dipeptidase, acetylhistidine deacetylase, N-acetylhistidine deacetylase, alpha-N-acetyl-L-histidine aminohydrolase) is an enzyme. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : Hydrolysis of anserine (beta-alanyl!Npi- methyl-L-histidine), carnosine, homocarnosine, glycyl!leucine and other dipeptides with broad specificity == References == == External links == * Category:EC 3.4.13
