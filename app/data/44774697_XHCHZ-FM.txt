XHCHZ-FM is a radio station in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas. Broadcasting on 107.9 FM, XHCHZ-FM is owned by the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio and broadcasts a music and information format under the name "Radio Lagarto". ==History== In the mid-1980s, an accord between IMER and the government of Chiapas led to the establishment of three new IMER stations: XERA-AM in San Cristóbal de las Casas, XECAH-AM in Cacahoatán and XEMIT-AM in Comitán. In 1990, this was split, and XERA stayed with the government of Chiapas while XECAH and XEMIT remained with IMER. As a replacement, XECHZ-AM 1560 took to the air in 1991.IMER: XHCHZ History XECHZ broadcast with 4.5 kW of power (due to an older transmitter), increasing its power to 20 kW with a new transmitter in 1994. In 2012, XHCHZ-FM 107.9 was signed on as part of the AM-FM migration campaign currently underway among Mexican radio stations. ===XHCHZ broadcasts in HD Radio=== *HD2 is a simulcast of XEB-AM. *HD3 is a simulcast of XEQK- AM.http://hdradio.com/mexico/estaciones HD Radio Guide for Mexico ==References== Category:Radio stations established in 1987 Category:Radio stations in Chiapas
