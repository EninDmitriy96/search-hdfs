The show's inaugural Hungarian season ended on 19 December 2010. Csaba Vastag was announced as the winner. It was broadcast on the commercial RTL Klub television station. ==Auditions== The auditions started in the summer of 2010, with more than 5,000 candidates for the first series in Hungary. ==Bootcamp== The Bootcamp was in the Thalia Theatre where 150 singers competed. In the first round the contestants sang a song of their choice. The judges immediately told the contestants if they were safe or not. In the second round only 50 contestants competed and they chose a song for themselves from a list. After this, based on the judges decision 24 contestants went to the third round called "Judge's houses". ==Judge's houses== At this stage of the competition each judge mentored six acts. Each judge had help from a guest judge to choose their final acts. Keresztes was helped by Zoltán Ádok, Malek by his sister Andrea Malek, Nagy by Dániel Abebe, and Geszti by Mariann Falusi. Contestants performed one song for their respective judge. Each judge and their guest eliminated three acts, leaving twelve remaining. The judges' houses stage was broadcast in two episodes on 9 and 10 October 2010. The twelve eliminated acts were: *Boys: Dávid Hegyi, Teó Spiriev, Előd Szabó *Girls: Enikő Muri, Katica Németh, Dzsenifer Szirota *Over 25s: Kriszta Bakó, Dávid Nádor, Zsolt Wittmann *Groups: Conformity, Karma, Nóra Réder és Kádár Szabolcs ==Contestants== The top twelve acts were confirmed as follows: The following artists made it to the live shows.
