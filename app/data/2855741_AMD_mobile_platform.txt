The AMD mobile platform is an open platform for laptops from AMD. Though little marketing was done on this platform, it has been competing with the Centrino platform in the segment to gain more marketshare. Each platform has its own specification, catching up the latest technology developments. Since the acquisition of ATI, AMD began to include Mobility Radeon GPUs and AMD chipsets as part of the requirements of the mobile platform; the first of such platforms is the Puma platform. ==Open platform approach== In February 2007, AMD had announced the "Better by Design" initiative to continue the success of the open platform approach AMD Open Platform Approach from AMD Analyst day presentations, slide 32 for desktop back in early 2003 after the launch of Athlon 64 processors with a lack of chipset being developed by AMD, and open the platform to chipset vendors such as VIA, SiS, NVIDIA and from AMD subsidiary ATI. The initiative also includes platforms succeeding the Kite Refresh mobile platform. Under the "Better by Design" initiative, AMD introduced a three-cell arrow sticker to identify mobile platform products, which the top cell being the processor (as Turion 64 X2). The middle cell for graphics accelerators as NVIDIA or ATI (as a result of retaining the use of "ATI Radeon" branding for graphics Retaining the ATI brand from AMD Analyst day presentations, slide 7), including onboard graphics (IGP), while the last cell representing the wireless (Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11 standard) or LAN solutions, provided by one of the following companies: Airgo, Atheros, Broadcom, Marvell, Qualcomm, and Realtek. The stickers to be used will be further classified by the system performance according to the processor performance, and into five classes, each having different colours as well as different logos for each component, listed as follows: Class Processor Sticker Related brands Other components Border Background Good Single-core Mobile Sempron grey white none Graphics: ATI (Mobility Radeon/Radeon Xpress), NVIDIA (GeForce/nForce IGP) Wireless connectivity and management: Broadcom, Qualcomm, Atheros, Airgo, Marvell, Realtek Good Dual-core Athlon X2 grey white Better Dual-core Turion 64 X2 Silver Silver Best Dual-core Turion 64 X2 Gold Gold Best Dual-core for digital media Turion 64 X2 Silver Silver w/ AMD Live! logo AMD Live!

Figures for Q1 and Q2 2007 are 15% and 17% unit share, accounting for 14% and 16% of the company's revenue respectively.AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 presentation , presented by Mario Rivas, page 7 of 28. Retrieved December 14, 2007 AMD's mobile platform, even as recent as the Turion 64 X2 platform, has been criticized as consistently performing worse than Intel's Centrino in all areas: system speed, heat dissipation, and battery life. ==Implementations== ===Initial platform (2003)=== Launched in 2003, the initial platform for mobile AMD processors consists of: AMD mobile Initial platform Mobile processor Processors - Socket 754 * Mobile Sempron single-core 32-bit processor (codenamed Dublin, Sonora, Roma), or * Mobile Athlon 64 single-core 64-bit processor (codenamed ClawHammer, Odessa, Oakville), or * Turion 64 single-core 64-bit processor (codenamed Lancaster) Mobile chipset * D-sub and HyperTransport 1.0 * DDR-400 SO-DIMM ===Kite platform (2006)=== Introduced in 2006, the Kite platform consists of: AMD mobile Kite platform Mobile processor Processors - Socket S1 * Mobile Sempron single-core 64-bit processor (codenamed Keene), or * Turion 64 single-core 64-bit processor (codenamed Richmond), or * Turion 64 X2 dual-core 64-bit processor (codenamed Taylor, Trinidad) Mobile chipset * DVI and HyperTransport 1.0 * DDR2-667 SO-DIMM Mobile support * Wireless IEEE 802.11 b/g mini-PCIe WiFi adapter ===Kite Refresh platform (2007)=== AMD used Kite Refresh as the codenamed for the second-generation AMD mobile platform introduced in February 2007.
