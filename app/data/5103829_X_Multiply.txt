is a horizontally scrolling shooter published by Irem, and similar in style to their earlier R-Type. In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn. In 2019, the game was released on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series, marking its first official release outside Japan. ==Gameplay== The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. Konami's Xexex is based on a fusion of this weaponry with the Force system of R-Type. In the PlayStation 2 game R-Type Final, the ship "RX-12 Cross The Rubicon" uses the "Flexible Force", a Force based on XMultiply with roughly the same attacks. ==Plot== The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249â€”the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of a person who has been invaded by the alien queen. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed X Multiply on their November 1, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade game of the year. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * *X Multiply at Arcade Archives Category:1989 video games Category:Arcade video games Category:Irem games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Video games about microbes Category:Video games about size change Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in the 23rd century
