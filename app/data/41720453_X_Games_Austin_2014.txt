X Games Austin 2014 was an action sporting event that took place over June 5–8, 2014, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. Another Venue used for the event was the Austin 360 Amphitheater. While the Summer X Games in past years was typically held in California, this was the first full X Games event to be held in the state of Texas; in 2003, a special "Global Championships" event was held in San Antonio, Texas. The games were originally announced to be held on May 15–18, but were slipped to the next month, the reason given by ESPN was for a more favorable broadcast window. X Games Austin gained a 4-day attendance of 160,000 and an all-time total of 5,069,115. It was also announced on the ESPN broadcast that next year's X Games will again be hosted in Austin, Texas and that a new event, Moto X Flat Track will make its debut. ==Results== ===Moto X=== Men's Moto X Enduro 8:35.484 8:37.829 8:41.462 Women's Moto X Enduro 5:16.365 5:26.480 5:44.419 Moto X Best Whip 33.00% 23.00% 18.00% Moto X Step Up 34.00 33.50 33.00 Men's Moto X Speed & Style 83.50 80.56 79.50 Moto X Freestyle Event canceled Event canceled Event canceled Event canceled Event canceled Event canceled ===Skateboarding=== Skateboard Freestyle Vert 87.00 85.66 84.00 Skateboard Big Air 89.00 88.00 87.00 Skateboard Park 90.66 84.00 81.00 Skateboard Street Amateurs 85.00 80.66 77.66 Women's Skateboard Street \- - - Men's Skateboard Street 95.00 87.66 85.66 Skateboard Real Street - - - ===BMX=== BMX Vert 92.66 89.66 88.33 BMX Freestyle Street 90.66 89.33 89.00 BMX Dirt 95.00 90.33 88.33 GoPro BMX Freestyle Big Air 90.66 89.66 87.66 ===Rallying & Off-Road Truck=== RallyCross Lites 5:22.019 5:24.333 5:29.036 RallyCross 4:12.072 4:17.480 4:28.472 Stadium Super Trucks 27:29.567 27:35.262 27:36.600 ===MLG X Games Invitational COD: Ghosts=== This X Games also awarded medals for E-Sports for the first time in a Call of Duty: Ghosts tournament co-organized by Major League Gaming.
