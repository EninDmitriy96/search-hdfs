XHCPAF-FM is a Mexican college radio station owned by the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de la Region Norte de Guerrero in Iguala. The station broadcasts on 103.3 MHz and is the only licensed university radio station in the state of Guerrero. ==History== The UTRNG first received a radio station permit in 2013 for XHUTG-FM 98.5. The station did not come to air for another three years. However, in that time, the university also failed to transition its permit to a public use concession and thus lost the frequency. As a result, the UTRNG filed for a new public station allocation at Iguala and received XHCPAF-FM 103.3 in October 2018, beginning operations by December. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Guerrero Category:University radio stations in Mexico
