The A5127 is a major road in England which runs between Birmingham and Lichfield, Staffordshire. For much of the route the road follows the old route of the A38 which has since been moved in order to by-pass places such as Erdington and Sutton Coldfield and form a relief road from Birmingham city centre to Spaghetti Junction. The part from the county boundary, through Shenstone to Lichfield was one of the roads of the Lichfield Turnpike Trust, established in 1729.Local Act, 2 Geo. II, c.5. Beyond Lichfield, it joins the Roman Ryknild Street at StreethayMargary, Ivan (1967). Roman Roads in Britain.
