She protested differential treatment of women to men in regards to admission polities. She also lobbied for more public restroom facilities for women. In 2012, Liang was an organizer who used performance art as a method of protest. Liang and other activists did a street demonstration where they protested by doing a performance on occupying men's restrooms. As part of these protests, she shaved her head. As a result of her activism, and specifically holding a seminar on women's rights, she was questioned by the police. In 2016, Liang moved to the United States. She said she felt pressure to stop activism. The police came to her parents' house, as did her parents' employer.

Liang is part of the ＃MeToo movement and conducts protests. She founded a grassroots feminist non-governmental organization (NGO) to combat inequality. Liang is a practicing attorney in New York City. ==Selected works and publications== * ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Chinese activists Category:1992 births Category:Chinese feminists Category:Living people Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:South China University of Technology alumni Category:Fordham University School of Law alumni
