The dorsal scales of the antennae are blackish brown and pinkish latero-basally. The abdomen has two rows of dorsal dots.

In one morph, the last instar has yellow eyes and a blue or green body. Adults are probably on wing year-round. ==References== juanita Category:Moths described in 1903 Category:Moths of South America
