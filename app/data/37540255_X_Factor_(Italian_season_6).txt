X Factor is an Italian television music competition to find new singing talent; the winner receives a € 300,000 recording contract with Sony Music. Before the start of the auditions process it was confirmed that Simona Ventura, Morgan, Elio and Arisa would be confirmed as judges and mentors; also Alessandro Cattelan returned as host, whilst Max Novaresi and Brenda Lodigiani return to host Xtra Factor. The sixths season began airing on Sky Uno on 20 September and ended on 7 December 2012. Auditions for season 6 took place in Rimini, Andria and Milan in June 2012; bootcamp took place in Milan for two days, on 28 and 29 June. Morgan mentored the Over-25s, Ventura the boys, Elio the girls and Arisa the groups; they selected their final three acts during judges' houses. The Live Shows started on 18 October at Teatro della Luna, Assago. On Live Show 3 (November 1), the 12 finalists were joined by a 13th wildcard, voted for by the public after each judge picked one of their rejected to return. Chiara Galiazzo, a member of the category Over-25s and mentored by Morgan, was announced the winner of the competition on 7 December 2012. Her winner's single, "Due respiri", released immediately after the end of the show, was co-written by Italian singer-songwriter Eros Ramazzotti. ==Judges, presenters and other personnel== Sky Italia entirely confirmed the cast of X Factor 5 for the sixths season. On 12 April 2012, Alessandro Cattelan was confirmed to present the main show on Sky Uno HD. Rumors about a possible replacement as a judge of Arisa with singer Gianna Nannini were soon denied, and indeed it was confirmed on 25 May that all the judges of the fifth series (Arisa, Simona Ventura, Elio, Morgan) would return to their role. Also vocal coaches Alberto Tafuri, Paola Folli and Giuseppe Barbera, music-director Lucio Fabbri and art-director and choreographer Luca Tomassini were confirmed, whilst vocal-coach Gaetano Cappa replaced Diego Calvetti in the role. ==Selection process== ===Applications and auditions=== A preliminary phase of auditions was held: *at Fiera del Levante, Bari, on 5 and 6 May 2012; *at MiCo, Milan, from 19 to 21 May; *at Foro Italico, Rome, from 26 to 28 May. The judges auditions were held: *at 105 Stadium, Rimini, on 9 and 10 June 2012; *at Palazzetto dello Sport, Andria, on 16 and 17 June; *at Teatro Nazionale, Milan, on 23 and 24 June. The first episode of audition was broadcast on 20 September 2009, and featured auditions from Rimini and Milan; Andria auditions, along with those from Rome, were shown on 27 September. Notable auditioners included Miss Italia 2011 Stefania Bivone, Michele Grandinetti, a singer already famous in Thailand with his stage name Miki del Re, and performer and actress Carmen Serra. ===Bootcamp=== 96 acts reached Bootcamp, which took place at the Teatro Nazionale in Milan over two days, on Thursday 28 and Friday 29 June, and was broadcast on 4 October. *On the first day, judges reviewed the audition tapes and sent home 1/3 of the acts before they had another chance to sing, soon after their arrival in Milan; *the remaining 65 acts were then put into groups and took part in a sing-off: each group was assigned a song to prepare for the next morning. Members of the groups could choose which part of the song to sing, in agreement with the other components. After each performance, the judges decided which acts to keep and which to eliminate. The number of acts was reduced to 41; *the acts had only 4 hours to choose one song from a list of 100 and perform it in front of the judges. Later, the judges decided which 24 acts to put through to judges' houses. At the end of Bootcamp, judges met the acts of the category they had to mentor: Girls were to be mentored by Elio, Boys by Simona Ventura, Groups by Arisa and Over-25 by Morgan. ===Judges' houses=== "Home visits" was broadcast on 11 October. Ventura mentored the Boys in Costa Smeralda, assisted by vocal coach Paola Folli; Elio took the Girls at Villa Gaia, Robecco sul Naviglio, assisted by Alberto Tafuri; Morgan had the over 25s in Teatro Regio, Parma, with Gaetano Cappa, and Arisa had the Groups in Lake Como with Giuseppe Barbera. One of the acts from the 25+ category, Mara Sottocornola, frightened by the mechanisms of the competition, decided to not take part in this phase, preferring to accept a proposal for an opera-stage in Brussels, and wasn't replaced. The eleven eliminated acts were: *Boys: Alessandro Mahmoud, Francesco Vecchio, Carmelo Veneziano Broccia *Girls: Gaya Misrachi, Marta Pedoni, Lucrezia Rossetti *25+: Didie Caria, Michele Grandinetti *Groups: Brutte Abitudini, Diamond Sisters, Up3Side ==Contestants and categories== Key: : - Winner : - Runner-up : - Third place Category (mentor) Acts Boys (Ventura) Nicola Aliotta Daniele Coletta Alessandro Mahmoud Davide Merlini Girls (Elio) Cixi Yendry Fiorentino Nice 25+ (Morgan) Romina Falconi Chiara Galiazzo Ics Groups (Arisa) Akmé Donatella Fréres Chaos ===Boys=== *Nicola Aliotta (born 26 April 1992) is a student from Rome.
