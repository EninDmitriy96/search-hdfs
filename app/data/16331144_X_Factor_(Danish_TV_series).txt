He also criticises that participants are obliged to travel at their own expense.Berlingske Tidende: DR beskyldes for at stavnsbinde unge (Danish) Bente Boserup, leader of BørneTelefonen, criticized the Danish X Factor for exposing children under 18 to high pressure and stress, after contestants Baraa Qadoura and Tannaz Hakami broke down in tears during the fourth live show of season 8. This was supported by psychologist John Halse, as well as contestant Finn Irs, who protested by not showing up to the all-stars song during the final live show. Irs stated that the producers were more interested in their contestants showing their emotions, rather than making a musical show. Jan Lagermand Lundme, the contributing editor on DR1, stated that all contestants were checked by a psychologist to see if they were fit to handle the pressure.Politiken: Børneeksperter: Fjern alle under 18 år fra X Factor. (Danish) Despite this, the series has remained quite popular within the Danish public. ==References== == External links == * X Factor website Category:Danish reality television series Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:2008 Danish television series debuts Category:Danish television series based on British television series Category:DR TV original programming
