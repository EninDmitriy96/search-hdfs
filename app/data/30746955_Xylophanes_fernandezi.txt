Xylophanes fernandezi is a moth of the family Sphingidae. It is known from Colombia and Venezuela. The length of the forewings is 44â€“47 mm. It is similar to Xylophanes tersa tersa and Xylophanes resta but differs in its dark, monotonous appearance. The head and thorax are dark brown to brown-black dorsally. The dorsal scaling of the antenna is dirty white. The abdomen is ash-brown dorsally with five dark longitudinal lines. The basal black patches are present. Laterally, stripes are paler rust-brown. The forewing upperside ground colour is ash-brown and the postmedian lines are indistinct (the fourth line is most prominent). The hindwing upperside is as in Xylophanes tersa tersa but the median band consists of a row of cream-coloured spots. The larvae probably feed on Rubiaceae and Malvaceae species. ==References== fernandezi Category:Moths described in 1996
