In 1929, the Zhangxia Navy established the Zengcuo Aun Naval Airport in Xiamen, and in 1932, the China Airlines Xiamen Office, a joint venture between China and the United States, operated air transportation to various places. Later, the airport was abandoned due to the Japanese invasion of China. In 1941, during the Second World War, the Japanese who occupied Xiamen built Gaoqi Airport in the east of Gaoqi Village for both military and civilian use. From December 5 of the same year, first commercial flight between Xiamen and Taipei took off and landed at Gaoqi Airport. After Japan's defeat and surrender, Gaoqi Airport was taken over by the Nationalist government and converted to a civilian airport on November 1, 1947. On August 24, 1949, the last scheduled Xiamen to Taipei flight took off from Gaoqi Airport to Taipei and then was discontinued (the route was not converted to a regular service until 2006 when holiday charters resumed and after December 2008).厦门国际航空港集团：大事记 For the next 33 years, Xiamen's aviation industry was disrupted and Gaoqi Airport was abandoned after a brief period of military use. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xiamen was in a state of war for a long time and had no civil aviation airport of its own because of its location on the front of the Taiwan Strait. At that time, the citizens of Xiamem could only travel by boat or train.This contradiction was even more prominent after the establishment of Xiamen Special Economic Zone. On January 10, 1982, the Central Military Commission and the State Council approved the construction of Xiamen Gaoqi Airport. In October of the following year. However, the airport had no airline that operated as a hub, and still could not solve the issue of lack of capacity.
