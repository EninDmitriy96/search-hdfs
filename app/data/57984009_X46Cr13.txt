X46Cr13 is the European Norm name for a common martensitic stainless steel with the numeric name 1.4034. It is equivalent to American Iron and Steel Institute standard 420C. It has the highest carbon content of the SAE 420 series.Stainless steels, table of technical properties Euro InoxStainless Steel Grades Datasheets BRITISH STAINLESS STEEL ASSOCIATION == Properties == X46Cr13 has good workability when hot, and potential to reach high hardness of up to 56 HRC. It contains a moderately high carbon ratio of approximately 0.46% which gives it a good compromise between high hardness and corrosion resistance for many applications.Comparison between X5CrNiCuNb16 and X46Cr13 under Corrosion Fatigue Marcus WolfProperties that Characterize the Material X46Cr13 Steel 8nd International Conference on Physical and Numerical Simulation of Materials Processing It is also relatively inexpensive to produce. X46Cr13 is a basic steel without molybdenum, nitrogen or vanadium. It can be outperformed (typically at a higher cost) by more advanced steels like N680 with similar carbon content.X46Cr13 datasheet Make it fromHow good is N680 steel Knife Up == Uses == Common uses include: * knife blades,X46Cr13 datasheet ZKnivesKnife Blades: Common Steels Explained (under 420 HC) Gear JunkieKnife Blade Materials (under 420HC) Knife centerKnife Steel FAQ (under 420HC) ZKnives * surgical instruments,CURRENT TRENDS IN COMMODITY SCIENCE * bearings,ISSF : Martensitic Stainless Steels * valves and pumps, * measuring devices * spring wire.1.4034 steel wire datasheet Jacques Allemann It is also used in the manufacture of heat treated steel pipes used for CO2 carbon capture and storage. A commercial variant of X46Cr13 with some Vanadium is known as 420HC and is used in the knife industry because of its ability to hold a superior edge.420HC datasheet ZKnives An NHTSA recall was issued by Porsche for spherical joints utilized in 2003-2005 Porsch Carrera GT models due to long term intergranular corrosion. == Standards == * EN numeric : 1.4034 * EN symbolic : X46Cr13 * Old AFNOR : Z40C13, Z44C14 * AISI : 420C * ASTM : F899 * UNS : S 42000 * JIS : SUS420 * GOST : 40Ch13 ou 40X13 * : 4H13 == Composition == According to EN 10088. * Carbon : 0.46 % (–0.03 / +0.04) * Chromium : 13% (–0.5 / +0.5) * Silicium < 1% * Manganese < 1% * Phosphorus < 0.04 % * Sulfur < 0.03 % == See also == * Steel grades * List of blade materials == References == Category:Stainless steel
