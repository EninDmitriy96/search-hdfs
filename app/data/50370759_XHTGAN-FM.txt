XHTGAN-FM is a community radio station on 107.1 FM in Tangancícuaro, Michoacán, Mexico. It is known as Radio Erandi. ==History== Radio Erandi, original callsign XHFC-FM, was permitted on March 14, 2005, but its story predates the original permit. Frente Cívico Tangancícuaro, Pueblo Unido, A.C., the original permitholder, was created in 2001 in response to abuses of power by the municipal government. In 2006, the station had an all-volunteer crew of announcers and staff. The original Radio Erandi permit wound up not renewed, and a new community concession was applied for to replace XHFC-FM. In December 2017, XHTGAN-FM 106.1 was approved to replace XHFC. On October 16, 2019, in order to resolve co-channel interference problems with XHCHIL-FM in Chilchota, XHTGAN was ordered to move to 107.1 MHz, carrying out the change on January 1, 2020.RPC: #039469 P/IFT/161019/499 Ordered Frequency Change — XHTGAN-FM ==References== Category:Radio stations in Michoacán Category:Community radio stations in Mexico Category:Radio stations established in 2005
