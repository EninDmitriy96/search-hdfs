XHVI-FM is a radio station on 99.1 FM in San Juan del Río, Querétaro, Mexico. It carries the national Exa FM format from MVS Radio. ==History== XEVI-AM came to air on 1310 kHz in 1962 as the first radio station to be based in San Juan del Río. Initially known as "La Estación del Pueblo", it was owned by General Ramón Rodríguez Familiar, the governor of Querétaro from 1935 to 1939 and founder of Querétaro radio stations XEJX (now XHJX-FM) and XENA (now XHNAQ-FM) and founded by Enrique Morales García. By the late 1960s, XEVI had moved to 1400. In the 1990s, the station came under the control of Martha Resendiz Osejo and became an FM combo; it was transferred to the current concessionaire, a business of the Morales Resendiz family, in 2009. On October 3, 2017, XEVI formally surrendered its AM frequency, becoming an FM-only station.RPC: #023357 Surrender of AM Frequency Notice - XHVI-FM ==References== Category:Radio stations in Querétaro Category:Radio stations established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in Mexico
