XHDCC-FM is a community radio station on 97.3 FM in San Ildefonso, Tepeji del Río de Ocampo, Hidalgo. XHDCC is owned by Desarrollo Comunitario y Cultural Ma Nguhe, A.C. and primarily broadcasts in Hñähñu. ==History== The station first went on air with transmitter tests in 2002, but its equipment was seized and the station forced off air. That forced the backers of Desarrollo Comunitario y Cultural Ma Nguhe, A.C. to begin the process of applying for a permit at a time when there were very few permitted community radio stations in Mexico. On July 29, 2005, Ma Nguhe received the permit for their station, XHDCC-FM; it had to buy a new transmitter to replace the one that was seized, and full programming began August 1, 2006. XHDCC is licensed for operation from 1pm to 10pm each day. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Hidalgo (state) Category:Community radio stations in Mexico Category:Otomi-language radio stations Category:Radio stations established in 2002
