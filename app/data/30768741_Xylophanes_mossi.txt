Xylophanes mossi is a moth of the family Sphingidae. It is known from Brazil. It is similar to Xylophanes rufescens, but the forewing upperside is uniform rust-brown and all other pattern elements are reduced or absent. Adults are probably on wing year-round. The larvae probably feed on Rubiaceae and Malvaceae species. ==References== mossi Category:Moths described in 1917 Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Moths of South America
