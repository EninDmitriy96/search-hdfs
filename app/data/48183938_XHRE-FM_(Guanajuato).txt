XHRE-FM/XERE-AM is a combo radio station in Celaya, Guanajuato. Owned by Grupo ACIR, XHRE/XERE broadcasts on 88.1 FM and 920 AM and carries a grupera format known as La Comadre. ==History== Rafael Sandoval Aguilar built and signed on XERE-AM at 1290 kHz from Salvatierra on September 19, 1968. Broadcasting with 250 watts, XERE was the first station in Salvatierra, joined less than two years later by a competitor, XEFAC-AM on 1380 kHz. In the 1970s and 1980s, it increased its power, and in 1994, it received its FM combo station; by this time, XERE had moved from Salvatierra to Celaya. The station was sold to Grupo ACIR not long after. ==References== Category:Regional Mexican radio stations Category:Radio stations in Guanajuato Category:Celaya Category:Grupo ACIR Category:1969 establishments in Mexico
