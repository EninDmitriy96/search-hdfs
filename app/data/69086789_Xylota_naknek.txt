Xylota naknek (Shannon, 1926), the Naknek Leafwalker , is a fairly common species of syrphid fly observed across Canada and the Northeastern United States. Syrphid flies are also known as Hover Flies or Flower Flies because the adults are frequently found hovering around flowers from which they feed on nectar and pollen. Adults are long. The larvae of this genus live under bark in sap runs. ==Distribution== Canada:British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Quebec United States:Alaska, Wisconsin New Hampshire, California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota.
