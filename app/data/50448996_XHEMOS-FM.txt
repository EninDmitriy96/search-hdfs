XHEMOS-FM is a radio station on 94.1 FM in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico. The station is operated by Promomedios Sinaloa and carries its Los 40 national format from Radiópolis. ==History== 150px|left|thumb|Logo used as Pop FM from 2014 to 2016 XEMOS-AM received its concession on October 28, 1994, operating on 1130 kHz as a 500-watt daytimer. XEMOS later boosted its power to 1 kW day with 250 watts at night. In the 2000s, this station became known as La Invasora with a grupera music format. The station was authorized to migrate to FM as XHEMOS-FM in 2011. The station was renamed La Poderosa before two format changes in the course of 2012: to W Radio in January and to English classic hits as Éxtasis Digital in October. In 2014, Radiorama began joint operations with Promomedios of the former's Los Mochis cluster. That resulted in new formats for XHEMOS and sister XHMIL-FM 90.1, with XHEMOS converting to pop music as Pop FM 94.1. In 2016, the format for XHEMOS was tweaked from straight pop to "Pop Love" with the addition of Spanish oldies to the station's playlist. The format was changed to the Radiópolis "Vox Love Station" format, largely in the same genre, in April 2020. It was the second station to adopt the brand and the first in nearly two years. On August 31, 2021, Vox was replaced by Los 40, which had been dropped by XHREV-FM 104.3 months prior when it was leased out. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Sinaloa Category:Mexican radio stations with expired concessions
