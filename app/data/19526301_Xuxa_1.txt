Her music became a part of El Show de Xuxa, and with the success of the song "Ilariê" beyond Brazil, a compilation of songs from her first three Portuguese albums was re- recorded in Spanish. Xuxa did not speak Spanish and took a language crash course, with special focus on pronunciation, in order to perform the songs for the album in Spanish. Song lyrics (like the names of the characters in the song "Bombom") were changed to keep the rhyme structure in the songs. The music composition was not rewritten but did experience many changes during the re-mix. The Spanish album brings together Xuxa's most popular songs, including "Ilariê" ("Ilarié"), "Doce Mel" ("Dulce Miel"), "Arco-Íris" ("Arco Iris"), "Dança da Xuxa" ("Danza de Xuxa"), and "Vamos Brincar de Índio" ("Juguemos a Los Indios"). == Production == The album was produced by Michael Sullivan, Paulo Massadas, and Guto Graça Mello, with artistic coordination by Max Pierre and Guto Graça Mello.

In each country, the design of the album cover, back cover, and the album booklet was changed to reflect differences in the song lyrics or data sheet.
