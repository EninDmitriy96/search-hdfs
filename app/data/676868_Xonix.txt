The objective is to fence off sections of a playfield while avoiding bouncing balls. ==Legacy== Xonix was popular at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre, where Dmitry Pavlovsky, one of the original developers of Tetris, was a computer engineer. Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov wrote their own version of Xonix called Antix.Gerasimov, Vadim. Tetris Story. It was first developed for the Electronika 60 and then ported to MS-DOS by Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov. ==References== ==External links== * * A C64 port of XONIX, called Zolyx, released by Firebird in 1987. * https://vadim.oversigma.com/Tetris.htm Category:DOS games Category:Action games Category:1984 video games Category:Video game clones Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Qix clones
