Nicolas de Toth was brought in to edit the movie for commercial purposes, and Fox ordered a number of reshoots. While Fox denied claims that Xavier Gens had been fired due to the extreme violence in his cut, and insisted that he was still on the project, some reports stated that Gens was not even in the country as these reshoots were being made. Hitman was a success with a gross of $92 million, Gens' most successful film. ==La Horde== He narrated and produced the French zombie film La Horde, directed by Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher. The film was released on 10 February 2010 and distributed by IFC Films. ==The Divide== Gens directed The Divide (initially titled The Fallout), his second English-language film, which features Michael Biehn in the lead role. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:French film directors Category:People from Dunkirk Category:French male film actors Category:Horror film directors
