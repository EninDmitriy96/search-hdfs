It took its calls from concessionaire Hugo Pennock Bravo and broadcast on 1400 kHz with 250 watts. In 1969, control passed to Radio Pitic, S.A., and power was increased to one kilowatt. Sometime in the early 2000s, XEPB moved to 950 kHz and increased its power to 10 kW. Radio S.A. bought XEPB in the 2000s and moved the station to FM in 2011. In April 2019, the station rebranded from Grupera 93.1 to Latino 93.1. The new format ended on August 31, 2020, when the station began airing El Heraldo Radio.
